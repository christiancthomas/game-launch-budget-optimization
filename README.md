# Game Launch Marketing Budget Optimization

### Problem summary

Game launches often involve a flurry of marketing activity across multiple channels: search, social, video, influencer, and more. Deciding how to allocate limited marketing budgets among these channels can have a significant impact on overall conversions and revenue. Without a structured approach, budget allocation decisions may rely on intuition or historical habits, which can lead to suboptimal results.

This project uses linear and quadratic programming to determine the optimal allocation of marketing budgets across channels. By modeling diminishing returns, budget constraints, and channel-specific caps, it aims to maximize conversions (or revenue) while providing transparency into trade-offs and sensitivity to changes.

### Business context

In a competitive launch environment, every marketing dollar counts. Game publishers and marketing teams need to:

1. Justify spend allocation with data-driven reasoning

2. Adapt budgets dynamically as performance data changes

3. Understand the marginal return of each channel at different spend levels

By providing a reproducible, optimization-based framework, this project gives launch teams a defensible and flexible tool for maximizing impact while staying within operational and financial limits.

### Current status

This repository is in its initial setup phase. The core problem framing and business context are defined, and the next steps will involve:

- Generating synthetic data to mimic realistic launch scenarios

- Fitting channel response curves with diminishing returns

- Building optimization models and running baseline allocation scenarios
