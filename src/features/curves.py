    Conversions as a quadratic function of spend.

    Business logic:
        This models the diminishing returns / saturation concept: after a certain point,
        each additional dollar spent yields progressively fewer conversions.

    Math:
        `y = a * spend - b * spend^2`
        Where:
        - 'y' is the total conversions at a level of spend
        - 'a' is the initial conversions per dollar (â‰ˆ CVR * CTR / CPC)
        - 'b' is the curvature that flattens performance as spend grows

    This is intentionally simple for V1: concave, monotone-increasing in our operating
    range, and easy to optimize with quadratic programming. Very likely that we'll build
    upon this in future versions with more advanced logic.
